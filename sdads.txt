React to NextJs : 

 

I've started learning Nextjs and  I noticed that NextJs does many thing that we have to do ourselves in React  .



Routing: we used react-router-dom to handle routing but in Next we use file based routing meaning creating folders and using that flder name as route 



Suspense: We just have to add a loading componet in the route and if there is a network call or promise that takes time the loading will appear before rendeing which is cool





 My first Project using Next Js is a Wikipedia search tool that fetches information directly from Wikipedia.I will share more about it later when it is completed.

 

I'm eager to expand my skills and build more projects! ðŸ’¡ If you have any project ideas that could be valuable or interesting, Iâ€™d love to hear them.  #NextJS #WebDevelopment #LearningJourney #ProjectIdeas
